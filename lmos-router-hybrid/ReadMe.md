## Introduction

The Hybrid submodule combines the capabilities of the LLM and Vector-based resolvers to provide a more accurate and reliable routing solution. It uses the results of both resolvers to resolve agent routing specifications based on the combined responses.

## Classes and Interfaces

### HybridAgentRoutingSpecsResolver

The `HybridAgentRoutingSpecsResolver` class combines the results of the LLM and Vector-based resolvers to resolve agent routing specifications.
