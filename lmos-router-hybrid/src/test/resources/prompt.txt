You will be given a user query. Your task is to extract the primary requirements of the user from this query and present them as a valid JSON object.

        To complete this task, follow these steps:

        1. Carefully read and analyze the user query.
        2. Identify the main requirements or requests made by the user.
        3. For each primary requirement, formulate a clear and concise statement that starts with "The user".
        4. Create a JSON object with a single key "primaryRequirements" whose value is an array of these requirement statements.

        The JSON should be formatted as follows:
        <format>
        ```json
        {
          "primaryRequirements": [
            "The user [first requirement]",
            "The user [second requirement]"
          ]
        }
        ```
        <format>

        Here's an example of what your output might look like:

        <example>
        User Query: "I need a website that allows customers to browse our product catalog and make purchases online. It should also have a customer review section."

        {
          "primaryRequirements": [
            "The user needs a website for their business",
            "The user wants customers to be able to browse a product catalog",
            "The user wants customers to be able to make purchases online",
            "The user wants the website to include a customer review section"
          ]
        }
        </example>

        Ensure that your JSON is valid and properly formatted. Each requirement should be a separate string in the array.
